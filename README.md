## U-Net and Greater U-Net Image Segmentation/Colorization
This project implements U-Net and Greater U-Net for image segmentation and colorization. The models are designed to process input images and generate enhanced outputs through deep learning. The project is built using PyTorch and includes scripts for training, testing, and evaluating both architectures.



# Project Overview
The project focuses on leveraging the U-Net and Greater U-Net architectures to perform image segmentation and colorization tasks. These architectures are based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and are particularly effective for tasks that require pixel-level precision, such as image segmentation and colorization.

U-Net is a popular architecture for image segmentation that uses an encoder-decoder structure with skip connections to preserve spatial information.

Greater U-Net is a modified version of U-Net with enhanced capabilities, designed to improve segmentation accuracy and handle more complex image data.
